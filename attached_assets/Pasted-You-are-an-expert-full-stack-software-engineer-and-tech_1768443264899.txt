You are an expert full-stack software engineer and technical writer. I want you to refactor and enhance the following project based on modern best practices across architecture, UI/UX, performance, testing, and documentation.

**TASKS:**

1. **Code Refactor**
   - Refactor the entire codebase for maintainability, modularity, and readability.
   - Apply up-to-date language features (e.g. ES2023, Python 3.12+, etc.).

2. **Debugging**
   - Identify and fix existing bugs in the codebase.
   - Ensure logic flow and syntax are correct throughout.

3. **UI/UX Refactor**
   - Modernize the UI using a framework (e.g. Tailwind CSS, Material UI).
   - Ensure the design is fully responsive and WCAG 2.2 accessible.
   - Follow mobile-first and component-driven best practices.

4. **Documentation**
   - Create or update:
     - `README.md` with overview, setup, usage, and deployment instructions.
     - Inline code comments and docstrings.
     - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger if applicable).
     - Contributing guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

5. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Add robust input validation and error boundaries.
   - Handle edge cases for forms, API inputs, user actions, etc.

6. **Testing**
   - Add or improve:
     - Smoke tests for core features.
     - Unit tests with at least 90% coverage.
     - End-to-end tests (E2E) for key user flows.

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching where needed (HTTP headers, memoization, Redis, etc.).
   - Add lazy loading for components, assets, or routes.
   - Apply code splitting and tree-shaking where applicable.

8. **PWA Integration**
   - Turn the frontend into a Progressive Web App (PWA):
     - Add `manifest.json` and a service worker.
     - Enable offline support and installability.
     - Ensure Lighthouse score >90 across performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

9. **Additional Enhancements**
   - Add security best practices (e.g., input sanitization, rate limiting, headers).
   - Set up automated linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier).
   - Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
   - Add Docker support for local and production environments if not present.

**Input Required:**
- Codebase: [Insert GitHub repo URL or ZIP]
- Tech Stack: [e.g., React + Node.js + PostgreSQL]
- Target Platform: [Web / Mobile / Desktop]

**Output Format:**
- For each task, provide:
  - ✅ Summary of changes
  - 🧠 Reasoning
  - 💻 Updated code snippets
- At the end, provide:
  - 📋 A full changelog
  - 🚀 Final recommendations for further improvements
